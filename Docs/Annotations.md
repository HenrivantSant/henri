## 7. Annotations
Annotations are everywhere in the systems and are an easy way to provide metadata to classes, properties and methods. Annotations are places in de the docblock, however from PHP8 it will be a native PHP functionality outside of the docblock.

### What & why annotations
As described above annotations are an easy and clear way the add additional meta data and configuration to classes, properties and methods. The systems uses annotations because this keeps everything together. There is not need to get info different configuration files for defining routes, etc. This keeps the code clean and makes it easy to see what's going on.
