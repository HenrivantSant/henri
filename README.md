## Looking for contributors!

## Intro
This is a simple, fast and basic PHP framework meant to write API's or simple programs in a fast and easy way. This is a not meant as a replacement for other frameworks,
under the hood it uses a lot of the magic from [Symfony](https://symfony.com/), [Dibi](https://github.com/dg/dibi), [Unirest](https://github.com/Kong/unirest-php) and [Firebase](https://github.com/firebase/php-jwt).

### Purpose  
This framework is not intended for building websites or big applications. The purpose of this framework is to provide a simple set of basic tools to build simple services, like: 
- Simple webservice
- API proxy to bundle several APIs endpoints into one
- Data caching layer
- API endpoint for React/Vue front-ends
- Logging service
- CDN
